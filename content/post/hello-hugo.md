In an on-line dynamic world, 
I need an off-line static place of my own to work distraction free, 
shut down all the sensory inputs, think, and write.
This might be the place. 
I am writing this with good old [vim](http://www.vim.org). 
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io) generates the htmls and [github](https:/github.com) serves the pages, so I always have backups!
Let see if this old fashioned and distraction free method of writing get me back in the mood of writing.

My old place was [blogspot](https://pnoq.blogspot.com), at that time, there were blogs and a google reader to read them all. 
Then came facebook, twitter, google plus, linkedin and bunch of other things. 
They destroyed my creativity.
